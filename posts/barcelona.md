One of our favorite restaurants of the trip. Fantastic food. Friendly service.
Try to sit at the bar. If there's a wait, they'll offer to come get you at their
sister bar/restaraunt ([La Cava (de la
Pepita)](https://foursquare.com/v/la-cava-de-la-pepita/54358878498e2c3c2059c200))
when they have room.

Another fantastic restaurant with great bar seating. The Croquetas de Sepia are
amazing.
